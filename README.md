## Description

I wanted to create a portfolio page to showcase my work, skills, and talent regarding coding. I wanted a site that future employers could go to that whould show them a lot of what I could do and what I've done. This shows five of my top projects that I have/will have completed. This was the first time I built a site from scratch and I learned a lot along the way.
