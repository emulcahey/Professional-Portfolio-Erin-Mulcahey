                My name is Erin Mulcahey and I'm in the process of becoming a full-stack developer. I currently hold the senior legal assistant job at a law firm in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have successully managed multiple previous Lead roles and have extensive experience with customer service. 
                These positions were in multiple fields, including coaching in gymnastics, restaurant serving staff, and managing multiple areas of a travel plaza.                 
                I would like to become a full-stack developer and obtain a job where I can use the related skills. I would like to continue developing my coding skills even after obtaining the standard certification.
                I love to explore the outdoors and have a goal of some day hiking the Appalachian Trail.
